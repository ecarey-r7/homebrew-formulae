homebrew-formulae
=================
This repo contains homebrew formulae used in some of my Chef recipes.

To manually use these formulae follow the [installation instructions](#how-do-i-install-these-formulae) below.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

Just `brew tap ecarey-r7/for` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install ecarey-r7/formulae/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

`brew install https://raw.github.com/ecarey-r7/homebrew-formulae/master/<formula>.rb`
